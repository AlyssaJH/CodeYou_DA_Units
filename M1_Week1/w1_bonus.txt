# A quadratic equation is an equation that can be written as "ax^2 + bx + c = 0".
# In this equation, "x" represents an unknown number, and "a", "b", and "c" represent known numbers.
# Possible solutions for a given quadratic equation can be calculated by the formula.
# The expression "b^2-4ac" is called the discriminant. Using the discriminant makes it easy to check the number of solutions for a given quadratic equation:
	# If the discriminant is 0, the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution.
	# If the discriminant is > 0, the quadratic equation has two real solutions.
	# If the discriminant is < 0, the quadratic equation has two complex solutions.
# Write a program that asks the user for the numbers "a", "b" and "c". The program should then print out how many solutions the quadratic equation has.
