# Write a program that expects the user to enter a sentence first and then a letter. 
# The program should output the entered sentence, removing each occurrence of the entered letter. 
# Additionally, the output loop should be constrained to print out a maximum of 20 characters only. 
# Hint: Using input(), first read the sentence and then the letter to be removed. Create an empty string using result = "". Then iterate over the letters. If a letter is not equal to the letter to be deleted, add that letter to the result (result += letter). After the for loop, output the variable "result". End (break) the loop early if the length of the result string is more than 20. 




sentence = input("Please enter a sentence: ")
sentence = sentence.lower()
