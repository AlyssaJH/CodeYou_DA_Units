# Then, output the numbers in that range with the appropriate increment. 
# Note: Remember to convert the inputs to the correct data type.

# FizzBuzz
# Write a program that outputs the numbers from 1 to 100. 
# All numbers that are divisible by 3 should be replaced by "Fizz". 
# All numbers that are divisible by 5 should be replaced by "Buzz".
# Numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 should be replaced by "FizzBuzz". 
# Note: You can check divisibility with the modulo operator (%).
