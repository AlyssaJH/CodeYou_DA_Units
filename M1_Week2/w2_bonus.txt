# In this exercise, you are going to simulate sales and operations planning using the 'zero stock level' strategy. 
# Write a python program that asks the user to enter the following data: 
	# An initial stock level for a product. 
	# The number of months to plan. 
	# The planned sales quantity for each month. 
# Based on the data, calculate the required production quantity as follows: 
	# If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0. 
	# If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is this difference. 





initial_stock = int(input("Please enter an initial stock level: "))
num_mos = int(input("Please enter the number of months to plan: "))

sales_quantities = []
for month in range(num_mos):
	planned_sales = int(input("Please enter the planned sales quantity: "))
	sales_quantities.append(planned_sales)

production_quantities = []
for month in range(num_mos):
	if initial_stock >= sales_quantities[month]:
		production_quantities.append(0)
		initial_stock -= sales_quantities[month]
	else:
		production = sales_quantities[month] - stock
		stock = 0
		production_quantities.append(production)
